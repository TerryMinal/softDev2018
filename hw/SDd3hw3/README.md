K#14: You are Smarter Than Most Congresspersons

Due M 2018-03-26, 8:00am, EST.


It's federal budget season and we thought you might like to know something about where the money goes.


With your table buddy, use D3 to create a webpage that displays information about the federal budget from 2 different years.
This website has pretty good data on federal budgets going back to the 1900s:
http://federal-budget.insidegov.com
Example D3 code has been posted to the notes and code repo: 
https://github.com/stuy-softdev/notes-and-code

Save in workshop under 14_d3-bars, as teamName_alastF-blastF.

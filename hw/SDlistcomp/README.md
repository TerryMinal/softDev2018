K #15: Do You Even List?

Due R 2018-04-26, 8:00am, EST.


Practice writing some list comprehensions in Python. Once you're comfortable, attack these:

Write a function that uses list comprehension to return whether a password meets a minimum threshold: it contains a mixture of upper- and lowercase letters, and at least one number
Write a function that uses list comprehension to return a password's strength rating. This function should return a lower integer for a weak password and a higher integer for a stronger password. (Suggested scale: 1-10) Consider these criteria:
mixture of upper- and lower-case
inclusion of numerals
inclusion of these non-alphanumeric chars: . ? ! & # , ; : - _ *
Save in workshop under 15_listcomp, as lastF.

K #07: Connect the Dots. . .

Due R 2018-03-01, 8:00am, EST.


Recreate your connect-the-dots HTML5/JS program using SVG instead of the canvas.


Each time the user clicks inside the SVG area, a circle should be drawn.
After the first circle, every subsequent click should also result in a line from from the previous circle to the next.
Include a clear button.
Note: clearRect() will not work; it is a canvas method. You need to remove all the circles somehowâ€¦

Save in workshop under 07_svg  as lastF.

import csv, sqlite3

# initialize database
db = sqlite3.connect("data.db")
c = db.cursor()

# add in the three tables PRIMARY KEY(id, course) makes the pair as the key
c.execute("CREATE TABLE peeps (name TEXT, age INTEGER, id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)")
c.execute("CREATE TABLE courses (course TEXT, grade INTEGER, id INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY(id, course))")
c.execute("CREATE TABLE peeps_avg (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, average INTEGER)")

# open the two files
csv1  = csv.DictReader(open("peeps.csv"))
csv2 = csv.DictReader(open("courses.csv"))

# enter in the csv values
for row in csv1:
    # print row
    c.execute("INSERT INTO peeps VALUES ('" + row['name'] + "', " + row['age'] + ", " + row['id'] + ")")

    # print row
    c.execute("INSERT INTO courses VALUES ('" + row['code'] + "', " + row['mark'] + ", " + row['id'] + ")")

K #09: Ask Circles [Change || Die]

2018-03-06

Create an HTML/JS program with the following features:

An SVG container

1 button: clear

Enable the following event listeners for the svg area:
* (Do NOT put all of this in a single event listener.)
* Clicking on a blank section of the svg area should create a circle at that position.
* Clicking on a circle once should change its color. (No new circles should be added to the svg container.)
* Clicking on a circle a second time should remove the circle and add a new one to the svg container at a random location.
